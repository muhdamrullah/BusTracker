BusTracker
============

by Muhammad Amrullah and Felicia Tan

BusTracker automatically extracts real-time data of bus arrival timings (at respective bus stops) and presents it in the form od a digital interface.

Current data extraction technology and digital visualisation methods target static data rather than dynamic data. This means that data can only be processed and analysed post-collection. BusTracker however, ensures updatedness. It automatically extracts data from mytransport.sg, an open data portal on the internet to find the locations of specific buses.

The interface is easily adjustable - whether through editing code or editing static images - for effective and user-interactive visualisation.
